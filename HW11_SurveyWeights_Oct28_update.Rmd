# Introduction

In this assignment, you'll examine how survey weighting affects our understanding of voting intentions across different education levels, using the data we examined in class. You'll calculate both weighted and unweighted statistics, create visualizations, and reflect on the implications for reporting.

## The Data

The nonvoters dataset contains survey responses about voting intentions and behaviors from a national survey. The survey was conducted prior to an election and includes demographic information like education level.

```{r}
# Load the dataset
nonvoters_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405_files/refs/heads/main/nonvoters_data.csv")

# Take a quick look at the data structure
glimpse(nonvoters_data)
```

### Key Variables

- `weight`: Survey weight assigned to each respondent
- `Q21`: Voting intention (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Unsure/Undecided)
- `educ`: Education level (College, Some college, High school or less)

## Task 1: Education Distribution

First, let's examine the distribution of education levels in our sample. **Replace "REPLACE_ME"** with the correct variable for education level.

```{r}

education_distribution <- nonvoters_data |>
  count(educ) |>
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)

education_distribution
```

## Task 2: Reflection Question

Why might education levels in survey samples often differ from the general population? What factors might cause certain education groups to be over or underrepresented?

**Write your ANSWER HERE**
College graduates are likely to be over-represented in voting polls (or surveys that generally cover more serious topics), because people with secondary education backgrounds are more likely to respond. This is due in some part to methodology, since polls like these may be linked in political articles or other social platforms that draw high levels of interest from college graduates. Effort also plays a role. Filling out a poll requires effort (not much, but some), and college graduates (who evidently have some dedication to earn a degree) are more likely to commit effort toward filling out a poll. As a byproduct of that, non-college graduates are likely underrepresented in polls.

## Task 3: Unweighted Analysis by Education

Now, let's calculate unweighted voting intentions by education level. This is what we would report if we didn't apply any weighting to our sample.

```{r}
# Calculate unweighted voting intentions by education
unweighted_by_education <- nonvoters_data |>
  # Filter out missing values
  filter(!is.na(Q21), Q21 > 0, !is.na(educ)) |>
  # Group by education and response
  group_by(educ, Q21) |>
  # Count responses
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop_last") |>
  # Calculate percentages
  mutate(total = sum(count),
         percentage = count / total * 100) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a more readable format with voting intentions as columns
unweighted_educ_summary <- unweighted_by_education |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = educ,
    names_from = Q21,
    values_from = percentage,
    names_prefix = "pct_"
  ) |>
  rename(
    "Yes (%)" = pct_1,
    "No (%)" = pct_2,
    "Unsure (%)" = pct_3
  )

unweighted_educ_summary
```

## Task 4: Reflection Question

Based just on this unweighted analysis, what headline might you write for a news story about education and voting intentions?

**Write your ANSWER HERE**

HL: College-education Americans turn out at the polls. For those who aren't, voting is less common 

## Task 5: Weighted Analysis by Education

Next, let's apply survey weights to see how this changes our results. Instead of just counting responses, we'll sum the weights for each group. **Replace "REPLACE_ME"** with the appropriate weight variable

```{r weighted-by-education}

weighted_by_education <- nonvoters_data |>
  # Filter out missing values
  filter(!is.na(Q21), Q21 > 0, !is.na(educ)) |>
  # Group by education and response
  group_by(educ, Q21) |>
  # Sum the weights instead of counting
  summarize(weighted_count = sum(weight), .groups = "drop_last") |>
  # Calculate weighted percentages
  mutate(weighted_total = sum(weighted_count),
         weighted_percentage = weighted_count / weighted_total * 100) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a more readable format
weighted_educ_summary <- weighted_by_education |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = educ,
    names_from = Q21,
    values_from = weighted_percentage,
    names_prefix = "pct_"
  ) |>
  rename(
    "Yes (%)" = pct_1,
    "No (%)" = pct_2,
    "Unsure (%)" = pct_3
  )

weighted_educ_summary
```

## Task 6: Reflection Questions

1. How did the percentages change after applying weights? Which education group showed the biggest changes?

Most weighted percentages stayed relatively similar to their respective unweighted percentages (within one percentage point). But there's some more noticeable change across all three "high school or less" categories. The biggest difference in particular from unweighted to weighted, was a nearly 3% drop in the yes category for those with high-school education or less than that.  

**Write your ANSWER HERE**

2. Why might the weighted results be considered more accurate than the unweighted results?

The weighted results are intended to account for over and under representation. As noted in the earlier responses, College-graduates are likely over represented in the sample, while non-college educated people are likely under represented. The weghted results are inteneded to correct those deficiancies by making the data set more reflective of the general population.   

**Write your ANSWER HERE**

## Task 7: Comparison of Weighted vs. Unweighted Results

Let's create a direct comparison table to see the differences more clearly.

```{r}

comparison <- unweighted_educ_summary |>
  inner_join(weighted_educ_summary, by = "educ", suffix = c("_unweighted", "_weighted")) |>
  mutate(
    # Calculate the differences between weighted and unweighted percentages
    yes_diff = `Yes (%)_weighted` - `Yes (%)_unweighted`,
    no_diff = `No (%)_weighted` - `No (%)_unweighted`,
    unsure_diff = `Unsure (%)_weighted` - `Unsure (%)_unweighted`
  ) |>
  # Select just the columns we want to display
  select(educ, yes_diff, no_diff, unsure_diff) |>
  rename(
    "Education Level" = educ,
    "Yes (% point diff)" = yes_diff,
    "No (% point diff)" = no_diff,
    "Unsure (% point diff)" = unsure_diff
  )

comparison
```

## Task 8: Reflection Question

Which education group shows the largest differences between weighted and unweighted results?

**Write your ANSWER HERE**

Those who's highest level of education was high school (or lower).

## Task 9: Visualization

Visualizations can help us see the differences more clearly. Let's create a bar chart comparing weighted and unweighted "Yes" responses by education level. **Replace "REPLACE_ME"** with the correct variable name

```{r}
educ_viz_data <- bind_rows(
  # Unweighted data
  unweighted_by_education |> 
    filter(Q21 == 1) |>  # Only "Yes" responses (Q21=1)
    mutate(Type = "Unweighted") |>
    select(Type, educ, percentage),
  
  # Weighted data - 
  weighted_by_education |> 
    filter(Q21 == 1) |>  # Only "Yes" responses
    mutate(
      Type = "Weighted",
      percentage = weighted_percentage
    ) |>
    select(Type, educ, percentage)
)

# Create a grouped bar chart
ggplot(educ_viz_data, 
       aes(x = educ, y = percentage, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.1f%%", percentage)), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Weighted vs. Unweighted 'Yes' Responses by Education",
    subtitle = "Q21: Do you plan to vote in the November election?",
    y = "Percentage (%)",
    x = "Education Level"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Unweighted" = "#619CFF", "Weighted" = "#F8766D")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```


## Task 10: Final Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important for journalists to understand survey weighting when reporting on polls?

**Write your ANSWER HERE** : Samples are intended to accurately represent a broader population, and one way that pollsters do that is by creating samples that accurately reflect the racial/ethnic and gender percentages of said population. But ultimately, that isn't always possible. As a result weighted samples help deliver results that more accurately reflect a population. It's important for journalists to recognize whether or not polls are weighted, so they can report the most accurate figures possible.   

2. How might the differences between weighted and unweighted results affect how you would report on this data?

**Write your ANSWER HERE** : I think we should try our best to seek weighted polls, or polls that we know accurately reflect the demographic breakdowns of a give population. But additionally, I think there's some value in reporting unweighted poll results, so long as we note the fact that they may not fully represent the demographic breakdown of the population.    

3. What additional information would you want to know about how the weights were calculated before using this data in a news story?

**Write your ANSWER HERE** : This isn't necessarily regarding the calculation One of things I've always wondered was what constitutes a significant difference between weighted and unweighted. For example, there's a nearly 3% difference between the weighted and unweighted percentages from the high school or less education level category. On the surface, that seems like a pretty minute difference, but I imagine that margin actually holds some weight. I think that would be helpful to know, so I have a better understanding of how much I can trust the unweighted data.
